redux concepts
1. store: connecting all the state slices
2. slices: these are components or pages that require to be accessed globally
ie. signinSlice, productSlice ,cartSlice because these cmoponents or pages will be accessed from different places in the app
3. actions: this describes the update to the state
4. reducers are pure functions: they take the current state, the action, returns the new state after being updated
5.dispatch: this dispatches an action ie.dispatch(action), and this action updates the state
6. selector: it allows us to access the global stateqew
